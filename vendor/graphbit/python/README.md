## What is GraphBit?

GraphBit is a source-available agentic AI framework for developers who need deterministic, concurrent, and low-overhead execution.

Built with a **Rust core** and a minimal **Python layer**, GraphBit delivers up to **68× lower CPU usage** and **140× lower memory footprint** than other frameworks, while maintaining equal or greater throughput.

It powers multi-agent workflows that run in parallel, persist memory across steps, self-recover from failures, and ensure **100% task reliability**. GraphBit is built for production workloads, from enterprise AI systems to low-resource edge deployments.

---

## Why GraphBit?

Efficiency decides who scales. GraphBit is built for developers who need deterministic, concurrent, and ultra-efficient AI execution without the overhead.

- **Rust-Powered Performance** - Maximum speed and memory safety at the core
- **Production-Ready** - Circuit breakers, retry policies, and fault recovery built-in
- **Resource Efficient** - Run on enterprise servers or low-resource edge devices
- **Multi-Agent Ready** - Parallel execution with shared memory across workflow steps
- **Observable** - Built-in tracing, structured logs, and performance metrics

---

## Benchmark

GraphBit was built for efficiency at scale—not theoretical claims, but measured results.

Our internal benchmark suite compared GraphBit to leading Python-based agent frameworks across identical workloads.

| Metric              | GraphBit        | Other Frameworks | Gain                     |
|:--------------------|:---------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------|
| CPU Usage           | 1.0× baseline   | 68.3× higher     | ~68× CPU                 |
| Memory Footprint    | 1.0× baseline   | 140× higher      | ~140× Memory             |
| Execution Speed     | ≈ equal / faster| —                | Consistent throughput    |
| Determinism         | 100% success    | Variable         | Guaranteed reliability   |

GraphBit consistently delivers production-grade efficiency across LLM calls, tool invocations, and multi-agent chains.

## When to Use GraphBit

Choose GraphBit if you need:

- **Production-grade multi-agent systems** that won't collapse under load
- **Type-safe execution** and reproducible outputs
- **Real-time orchestration** for hybrid or streaming AI applications
- **Rust-level efficiency** with Python-level ergonomics

If you're scaling beyond prototypes or care about runtime determinism, GraphBit is for you.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Recommended to use virtual environment.

```bash
pip install graphbit
```

### Environment Setup

Set up API keys you want to use in your project:
```bash
# OpenAI (optional – required if using OpenAI models)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Anthropic (optional – required if using Anthropic models)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

> **Security Note**: Never commit API keys to version control. Always use environment variables or secure secret management.

### Basic Usage

```python
import os

from graphbit import LlmConfig, Executor, Workflow, Node, tool

# Initialize and configure
config = LlmConfig.openai(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), "gpt-4o-mini")

# Create executor
executor = Executor(config)

# Create tools with clear descriptions for LLM selection
@tool(_description="Get current weather information for any city")
def get_weather(location: str) -> dict:
    return {"location": location, "temperature": 22, "condition": "sunny"}

@tool(_description="Perform mathematical calculations and return results")
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    return f"Result: {eval(expression)}"

# Build workflow
workflow = Workflow("Analysis Pipeline")

# Create agent nodes
smart_agent = Node.agent(
    name="Smart Agent",
    prompt="What's the weather in Paris and calculate 15 + 27?",
    system_prompt="You are an assistant skilled in weather lookup and math calculations. Use tools to answer queries accurately.",
    tools=[get_weather, calculate]
)

processor = Node.agent(
    name="Data Processor",
    prompt="Process the results obtained from Smart Agent.",
    system_prompt="""You process and organize results from other agents.

    - Summarize and clarify key points
    - Structure your output for easy reading
    - Focus on actionable insights
    """
)

# Connect and execute
id1 = workflow.add_node(smart_agent)
id2 = workflow.add_node(processor)
workflow.connect(id1, id2)

result = executor.execute(workflow)
print(f"Workflow completed: {result.is_success()}")
print("\nSmart Agent Output: \n", result.get_node_output("Smart Agent"))
print("\nData Processor Output: \n", result.get_node_output("Data Processor"))
```
