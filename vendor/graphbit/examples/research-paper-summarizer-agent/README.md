# Research Paper Summarizer Agent

A powerful research paper analysis and Q&A system built with the **GraphBit framework**. This application automatically extracts, summarizes, and enables intelligent questioning of research papers using advanced AI capabilities.

## 🌟 Features

- **📄 PDF Processing**: Upload and automatically process research papers in PDF format
- **📝 Section-wise Summarization**: Intelligent extraction and summarization of paper sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.)
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Advanced vector-based search through paper content using embeddings
- **💬 Interactive Q&A**: Ask natural language questions about the paper content
- **⚡ Caching System**: Smart caching for faster re-processing of previously analyzed papers
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive Streamlit interface with enhanced user experience
- **🔧 GraphBit Integration**: Built on GraphBit's powerful workflow automation framework

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture powered by GraphBit's native document processing:

```

### Components

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application for user interaction
- **Backend**: FastAPI server handling PDF processing and Q&A
- **GraphBit Framework**: Core AI workflow orchestration with native document processing
- **Vector Store**: FAISS-based semantic search and retrieval
- **Caching Layer**: Persistent storage for processed papers

### 🚀 GraphBit Document Processing Enhancements

This application leverages GraphBit's advanced document processing capabilities:

- **Native PDF Processing**: Uses GraphBit's `DocumentLoader` for robust PDF text extraction with formatting preservation
- **Intelligent Text Splitting**: Employs GraphBit's `TextSplitter` with recursive splitting strategy that:
  - Preserves semantic boundaries (paragraphs, sentences)
  - Maintains context across chunks with intelligent overlap
  - Adapts chunk sizes based on section types (methods, results, etc.)
  - Handles academic text structure optimally
- **Context-Aware Chunking**: Section-specific chunking strategies that preserve research paper structure
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Better context preservation leads to more accurate question answering

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Poetry installed (see: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InfinitiBit/graphbit.git
   cd graphbit/examples/research-paper-summarizer-agent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This will automatically install GraphBit from PyPI along with all other required dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Using Poetry

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   # In terminal 1 - from the main graphbit directory
   poetry run uvicorn examples.research-paper-summarizer-agent.backend.main-server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   # In terminal 2 - from the main graphbit directory
   poetry run streamlit run examples/research-paper-summarizer-agent/frontend/app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```

**Note**: The application will automatically use the GraphBit framework installed from PyPI.

### Access the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:8501
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Upload a Research Paper

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Choose a PDF file" and select your research paper
3. Wait for the processing to complete (this may take 1-2 minutes for the first time)
4. View the generated section-wise summaries

### 2. Explore Summaries

- **Tabbed View**: For papers with many sections, summaries are organized in tabs
- **Expandable Sections**: For shorter papers, use expandable sections
- **Section Order**: Summaries follow standard academic paper structure

### 3. Ask Questions

1. Scroll to the "Q&A about the Paper" section
2. Type your question in the text area
3. Click "Ask Question" to get an AI-generated answer
4. View conversation history and ask follow-up questions
