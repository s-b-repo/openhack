"""Canonical registry of `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_*` environment variables.

Every env var the app reads whose name starts with `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_` must
be defined here as a module-level constant.  A drift-detection test
(`tests/unit_tests/test_env_vars.py`) fails when a bare string literal
like `"DEEPAGENTS_CODE_FOO"` appears in source code instead of a constant
imported from this module.

Import the short-name constants (e.g. `AUTO_UPDATE`, `DEBUG`) and pass them
to `os.environ.get()` instead of using raw string literals. If the env var is
ever renamed, only the value here changes.

!!! note

    `resolve_env_var` also supports a dynamic prefix override for API keys
    and provider credentials: setting `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_{NAME}` takes priority
    over `{NAME}`.  For example, `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_OPENAI_API_KEY` overrides
    `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Only call sites that use `resolve_env_var` benefit from
    this -- direct `os.environ.get` lookups (like the constants below) do not.
    Dynamic overrides are not listed here because they mirror third-party
    variable names.

Unset (the default) reuses the main agent model, preserving the historical

separate — typically faster and cheaper — model without changing the model that
writes code. The classifier is a security control: a model that cannot be
resolved (bad spec, missing credentials, uninstalled provider package) never
falls back to the main model — reviewed actions are denied, and repeated
failures escalate to your approval. Also settable via `[models].auto_classifier`

This is user-controlled process env, not a repo file: a committed *project*
