ASK_USER_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Ask the user one or more questions when you need clarification or input before proceeding.

Each question can be either:
- "text": Free-form text response from the user
- "multiple_choice": User selects from predefined options (an "Other" option is always available)

For multiple choice questions, provide a list of choices. The user can pick one or type a custom answer via the "Other" option.

By default all questions are required. Set "required" to false for optional questions that the user can skip. Do not include "(required)", "(optional)", "- optional", or similar annotations in the question text — the UI renders that separately based on the "required" field.

Use this tool when:
- You need clarification on ambiguous requirements
- You want the user to choose between multiple valid approaches
- You need specific information only the user can provide
- You want to confirm a plan before executing it

Do NOT use this tool for:
- Simple yes/no confirmations (just proceed with your best judgment)
- Questions you can answer yourself from context
- Trivial decisions that don't meaningfully affect the outcome"""  # noqa: E501

ASK_USER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """## `ask_user`

You have access to the `ask_user` tool to ask the user questions when you need clarification or input.
Use this tool sparingly - only when you genuinely need information from the user that you cannot determine from context.

When using `ask_user`:
- Be concise and specific with your questions
- Use multiple choice when there are clear options to choose from
- Use text input when you need free-form responses
- Group related questions into a single ask_user call rather than making multiple calls
- Never ask questions you can answer yourself from the available context"""  # noqa: E501
