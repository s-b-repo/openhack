"""Aggregate Harbor shard results into dataset-level pass@K and avg@K metrics.

Reads every per-trial ``result.json`` under a directory tree (the merged output
of all shard artifacts), groups trials by task, and computes:

  - pass@K  the fraction of tasks that passed at least once within K rollouts
            (K = rollouts_per_task; only this single k is reported).
  - avg@K   passing trials (capped at K per task, so duplicated rollouts cannot
            push a task above 1) over the EXPECTED trial count (tasks * rollouts),
            so missing rollouts of a present task count as failures.

The summary is flagged ``incomplete`` when a full run cannot be vouched for:
the matrix job did not fully succeed (``--harbor-result`` != "success"); a
present task ran a number of trials other than K (missing OR duplicated
rollouts); a ``result.json`` could not be read; a reward was present but
non-numeric; or (when ``--expected-shards`` is given) fewer shards completed than
expected. Legitimately-empty shards upload ``empty-shard-*`` markers and count as
completed rather than missing.

A trial is a pass when its verifier reward is >= PASS_THRESHOLD. ``errored`` is
an independent diagnostic tally: a Harbor result that records ``exception_info``
and a verifier-passing reward counts as both passed and errored. Missing or
non-numeric verifier rewards are not passes and are counted as errored.

Aggregation is single-model on purpose: a run is one model's evaluation of one
dataset (a "category" in the wider harness). If results from more than one model
are present the script exits with an error rather than silently mixing them;
per-model aggregation is deferred until multi-model runs are supported.

Completeness is measured relative to the tasks and empty-shard markers that
reported. A whole shard whose artifact never uploaded contributes neither, so
pass ``--expected-shards`` when the caller knows the authoritative shard count.
Successful empty shards remain distinguishable from missing artifacts because
the workflow uploads one ``empty-shard-*`` marker for each no-op slice.

Outputs two plain files in the output directory:
  - summary.json     dataset-level rollup (no per-task detail)
  - per_task.jsonl   one JSON object per task, one per line

The summary carries ``dataset`` and ``model`` so a future cross-category step
can combine several per-category summaries into an overall score.

When run inside GitHub Actions, a short markdown table is also appended to the
file named by GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY. Workflow-command annotations
(``::warning::`` / ``::error::``) are printed to stdout, which is the only
stream GitHub reliably parses them from.
