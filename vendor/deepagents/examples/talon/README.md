# Talon Example

This example runs a Talon host process with one or more channel adapters in the same container. The host `~/talon-workspace/` directory is mounted at `/workspace`.

> **Experimental:** Talon is an experimental runtime and is subject to change or removal at any time.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p ~/talon-workspace ~/.deepagents
# Fill AGENT_MODEL provider credentials, then uncomment the channel you want to use.
# Build once and run:
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

### WhatsApp

Uncomment the WhatsApp env vars in `.env` and scan the QR code printed by the bridge. The default exposure mode is `self`, so only messages sent by the paired WhatsApp account trigger the agent. Use `allowlist` or `open` only when you intentionally want other chats to trigger the agent.

### Telegram

Uncomment the Telegram env vars in `.env` and set `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. The default exposure mode is `self`, which requires `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_ID` to identify your Telegram user ID. Use `allowlist` or `open` only when you intentionally want other chats to trigger the agent.

## Voice Transcription

Voice transcription is enabled by default in `.env.example`. The Docker example installs `ffmpeg` plus the Talon `media` extra, so inbound voice notes are transcribed locally with NVIDIA Parakeet through Transformers before reaching the agent. The first voice message can be slow because the ASR model is downloaded lazily. Set `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_DEVICE=cuda` when running on a GPU-enabled host.

Cron records, downloaded inbound media, and channel session state persist under `~/.deepagents/<assistant-id>/`. The agent's default working directory is `/workspace`, so files it creates are written into `~/talon-workspace/` on the host.

The image installs the Talon package at build time. Rebuild after changing the Dockerfile, system packages, Node dependencies, or Talon Python dependencies.

## Local Run Without Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
set -a
. ./.env
set +a

cd ../../libs/talon/deepagents_talon/channels/whatsapp_bridge
npm install

cd ../../../..
uv sync --directory libs/talon --extra media
mkdir -p ~/.deepagents/talon-local/agents
cp examples/talon/AGENTS.md ~/.deepagents/talon-local/AGENTS.md
export DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WORKSPACE=~/talon-workspace
uv run --directory libs/talon deepagents-talon --whatsapp
```

For Telegram, use `--telegram` instead of `--whatsapp`:

```bash
uv run --directory libs/talon deepagents-talon --telegram
```

## Environment Reference

`AGENT_ASSISTANT_ID` names the local state directory under `~/.deepagents/`. The materialized assistant lives at `~/.deepagents/<assistant-id>/AGENTS.md`, with custom subagents under `~/.deepagents/<assistant-id>/agents/`. `AGENT_MODEL` selects the Deep Agents chat model. If it is unset, Talon runs the echo runtime for smoke tests.

The Docker example mounts `~/.deepagents` to `/root/.deepagents`, so cron jobs are stored at `~/.deepagents/<assistant-id>/cron/jobs.json`. Assistant Markdown image/video attachments must use relative paths inside `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_OUTBOUND_MEDIA_DIR`, or inside `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WORKSPACE` when no outbound media directory is configured.

Set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` to trace each channel or cron-triggered run. `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` defaults to `deepagents-talon`.

WhatsApp exposure:

- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WHATSAPP_EXPOSURE=self` allows only messages from the paired account.
- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WHATSAPP_EXPOSURE=allowlist` allows chats in `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WHATSAPP_ALLOWLIST_CHATS` or messages matching `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WHATSAPP_MENTION_PATTERNS`.
- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_WHATSAPP_EXPOSURE=open` allows every inbound WhatsApp message.

Telegram exposure:

- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_EXPOSURE=self` allows only messages from the operator ID set in `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_ID`.
- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_EXPOSURE=allowlist` allows chats in `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_ALLOWLIST_CHATS`, users in `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_ALLOWLIST_USERS`, or messages matching `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_MENTION_PATTERNS`.
- `DEEPAGENTS_TALON_TELEGRAM_EXPOSURE=open` allows every inbound Telegram message.

Cron jobs are stored in the assistant state directory at `cron/jobs.json`. Scheduler ticks, dispatch, success/failure, and delivery outcomes are logged as `talon_event` JSON records.
